# FOMC Statements

This is a repository of all FOMC [Policy Statements](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm#policy) and [Implementation Notes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/new-implementation-note-and-how-does-it-differ-from-the-fomc-postmeeting-statement.htm) from 1994-present.

## Rationale

> Indeed, expectations matter so much that a central bank may be able to help make policy more effective by working to shape those expectations. -- Chairman Ben S. Bernanke 

As the FOMC has become reliant on [communication as a policy tool](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20131119a.htm), market participants carefully monitor FOMC communication and its changes over time. By leveraging [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a tool used by software developers to track revisions of their software files, we can treat each statement released as a revision of the [first statement](https://github.com/fomc/statements/blob/master/statements/19940204.txt) they released in 1994 and easily see how it changes over time.

## Project Organization

There are two main files in this project: [statement.txt](https://github.com/fomc/statements/blob/master/statement.txt) and [implementation_note.txt](https://github.com/fomc/statements/blob/master/implementation_note.txt). Each will always contain the most up-to-date Policy Statement and Implementation Note from the FOMC. By viewing the history of each file, you can timetravel back through history and see how these communications have changed over time:

* [Policy Statement Changes](https://github.com/fomc/statements/commits/master/statement.txt)
* [Implementation Note Changes](https://github.com/fomc/statements/commits/master/implementation_note.txt)

There are also two directories: [statements](https://github.com/fomc/statements/tree/master/statements) and [implementation_notes](https://github.com/fomc/statements/tree/master/implementation_notes) which contain all of the FOMC communications since 1994 as text files. These statements can be downloaded and used for automated analysis if one so chooses.

## Search

Another powerful benefit of having these statements in GitHub is the ability to leverage [search](https://github.com/fomc/statements/search). Here are some relevant examples:

* [Inflation](https://github.com/fomc/statements/search?o=desc&q=inflation&s=indexed&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
* [Interest Rate](https://github.com/fomc/statements/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=interest+rate&type=Code)
* [Mandate](https://github.com/fomc/statements/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mandate&type=Code)

## Discussion

As this is a public repository on GitHub, we can now have a centralized discussion about any of these communcations or any of changes between communcations using the comment functionality. For instance, we [can have a discussion](https://github.com/fomc/statements/commit/65982075a5613fcfa4e3d1e5fb48c31deb9027d9#commitcomment-18433385) about the subtle change in words between two statements.

## Process

All of the content in this project was pulled directly from the Federal Reserve website. [Notes on process](https://github.com/fomc/statements/wiki/Process-Notes) can be found in the wiki.
